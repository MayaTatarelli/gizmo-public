% Example compile-time options:
%  (HYDRO_MESHLESS_FINITE_MASS is optional, replace with your
%   choice of hydro/mhd options)
%
%        HYDRO_MESHLESS_FINITE_MASS
%        BOX_PERIODIC
%        BOX_SPATIAL_DIMENSION=2
%        SELFGRAVITY_OFF
%        EOS_GAMMA=(5.0/3.0)
%        KERNEL_FUNCTION=5
%
% (The choice of KERNEL_FUNCTION is optional here. Experiment with different kernels.
%   But be sure to set DesNumNgb accordingly; for e.g. KERNEL_FUNCTION=5 or 7, use 40-50, =3 or 4, use 20-32)
%
% the parameters above are required for the hydro version of this problem.  
%   (modulo, of course, the choice of hydro method). For the MHD version of the 
%   problem, additionally enable:
%
%        MAGNETIC
%        MHD_B_SET_IN_PARAMS
%
% and then set the relevant BiniX, BiniY, BiniZ parameters below
%
% note that the default setup of this problem is inviscid, so the small-scale structure is always
%   'seeded' by grid noise, and there is no "converged" solution in the non-linear structure (the structure
%   should appear at infinitely small scales, at infinite resolution). Following
%   Lecoanet et al. 2016 (MNRAS, 455, 4274), to actually obtain define-ably converged solutions,
%   need to make the system have a finite Reynolds number. To do this, add finite viscosity. So experiment
%   with the flags:
%
%        CONDUCTION
%        VISCOSITY
%
% which are controlled by the flags 'ShearViscosityCoeff', 'BulkViscosityCoeff', 'ConductionCoeff' (see below)
