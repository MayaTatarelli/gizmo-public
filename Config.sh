# PEBBLE_ACCRETION_TESTPROBLEM # special flags/custom code just for this problem (search for it to find what may need to be modified)
# #HYDRO_FIX_MESH_MOTION=4 # this fixes the gas cells on shearing orbits: allows more like a 'regular grid': better in low-density regions but less resolution at high-rho
# BOX_SPATIAL_DIMENSION=2 # (optional: set=2,1 for 2D,1D box)
# BOX_SHEARING=2 # shearing box boundaries: 1=r-z sheet (r,z,phi coordinates), 2=r-phi sheet (r,phi,z), 3=r-phi-z box, 4=as 3, with vertical gravity
# EOS_GAMMA=(1.001) # eos (setting exactly=1 causes division by zero, so for 1->1.00001; for adiabatic set =7./4.)
# EOS_ENFORCE_ADIABAT=(1.0) # enforce EOS even in shocks/viscosity (cool back to isotherm/barytrope; disable to allow entropy evolution)
# # (options below here are unlikely to change, though of course possible to do so)
# BOX_PERIODIC # box is periodic in dimensions not otherwise constrained
# #HYDRO_MESHLESS_FINITE_VOLUME # default to MFV hydro (allow mass fluxes)
# HYDRO_MESHLESS_FINITE_MASS
# SELFGRAVITY_OFF # no self-gravity
# GRAIN_FLUID # enable dust particles (master switch)
# GRAIN_BACKREACTION # include back-reaction of grains pushing on gas (necessary for these instabilities)
# GRAIN_RDI_TESTPROBLEM # adds variables to read and ICs to appropriately set up the problem
# SPAWN_PARTICLES_VIA_SPLITTING # master switch needed to allow particle-spawning at the boundary for this problem
# BOX_BND_PARTICLES # allows existence of special boundary particles (needed for our 'spawners')
# BOX_SHEARING_Q=(3./2.) # shearing box q=-dlnOmega/dlnr; will default to 3/2 (Keplerian) if not set
